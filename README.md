## PiHoneyPot

This is a bash script to install/run Honeypot projects on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian OS).

This has only been slightly tested and can be used as a guide for installing some of these projects on your own.

## How to Run

Either run git clone this repository or use wget:

- sudo chmod +x install_HoneyPi.sh

- ./pihoneypot.sh

- sudo chmod +x pihoneypot.sh

- ./pihoneypot.sh
